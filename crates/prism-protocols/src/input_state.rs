//! Distinct from `redraw.rs` (per-output redraw state machine) — this
//! is per-seat state that input dispatch reads and writes. The actual
//! dispatch logic lives in the `prism-input` crate; this file just
//! declares the types the dispatcher mutates.
//!
//! Currently slim because most of niri's `KeyboardFocus` variants
//! correspond to subsystems prism does not yet have (lock screen,
//! screenshot UI, exit-confirm dialog, overview, MRU). We keep the enum
//! form rather than collapsing to `Option<WlSurface>` so the grow path
