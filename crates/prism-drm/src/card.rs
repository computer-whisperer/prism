//! Per-card DRM context.
//!
//! Layered above [`SeatSession`] (one per process, owns libseat) and below
//! [`OutputContext`] (one per active connector, owns the scanout pipeline).
//! A `DrmCardContext` is **one per `/dev/dri/cardN` we drive**: it holds
//! the `DrmDevice` (kernel-side card handle, opened through libseat so it
//! has DRM master when the session is active) and a matching `GbmDevice`
//! (same fd, required for GEM-handle compatibility with `addfb2`).
//!
//! Multiple outputs on the same card share their `DrmCardContext` —
//! one DRM device, many surfaces. Multi-GPU systems have one
//! `DrmCardContext` per card; each is matched to a Vulkan device via
//! [`DrmDevId`] (drm major/minor of the primary node).
//!
//! Owns the per-card `DrmDeviceNotifier`-companion at construction
//! time only — returned to the caller so it can be inserted into calloop
//! alongside the session notifier.
